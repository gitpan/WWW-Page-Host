NAME
    WWW::Page::Host - return a uniform name for virtual hosts

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Page::Host;
        print get_host('http://www.apple.com/');

DESCRIPTION
    The WWW::Page::Host module tries to return a canonicalish name for a
    virtual host. It uses DNS to accomplish this.

    This has its uses (or at least it must since the boss asked for a
    program that does something like this).

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    my $canon = get_host($url);
        Given a URL (either a string or a URI::URL object), this
        function plays around with a DNS resolver to try to get to a
        reasonably canonical name for the domain of the given URL.

PLANS
        It needs to cater for more weird and unusual ways of putting
        dates on web pages.
